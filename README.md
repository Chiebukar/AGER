# Age_Gender_Emotion_Race
 This repository contains files Used in building and testing models for facial recognition and prediction of common human  attributes such as age, gender, emotion and race.
 
The datasets used for this project where gotten thus:
(i) Dataset for Age and Gender recognition: IMDB faces cropped datset with metadata (https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/) \n
(ii) Dataset for Emotion detection : Ckplus dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/shawon10/ckplus)
(iii) Dataset for race deection: FairFace dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/aibloy/fairface)

pretrained weights and models models during this project can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VBIfs1vsvIYkqlMO4-X2lsQfbFezgLm9?usp=sharing
The icons used for each label can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u4qkqysnxVaExIkMvFG2L57_G8DlCvsx?usp=sharing

All the notebooks are created using google colab, follow the colab link  in each notebook for better viewing and usage.
